1. Day_7 part 2 was difficult.
    Read about scheduling, multi threaded scheduling, dependency scheduling.
2. Day_8 was difficult.
    Read and code a _lot_ more recursion problems. That thing is crazy bad.
3. Day_10 no time to look at the puzzle.
    It seems to depende on human factor so would be difficult? Too busy with work today - no time to dig into it.
